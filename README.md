## 🧠 What is ForgeRank?

ForgeRank is a Chrome extension that auto-detects backlinks and keywords as you visit pages.  
It quietly scans in the background and surfaces valuable SEO data without interrupting your flow.

- Track who’s linking to your site, live
- See anchor text, page title, and timestamp
- Log mentions as proof of traction
- Works while you browse normally — no need to run manual scans

## 🔥 Why?

Because backlink tracking is usually a chore.
